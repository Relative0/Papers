# P02 revision package - 27 September 2026

## Revised paper

**Exact Bernstein--Vazirani Query Complexity in Characteristic-Two Modal Computation**  
*Adaptive complete readout, oracle contracts, and related obstructions*

The revision centers the exact characteristic-two BV theorem, adds a worked `n=2` obstruction and an alternative point-indicator proof, expands the closest-prior-art comparison, moves secondary ring/computational material to appendices, and repairs the evidence package.

## Recovered full reproduction supplement

The original portfolio-level reproduction supplement recovered from the new attachments is delivered separately as:

`P02_Recovered_Original_Reproduction_Supplement.zip`

It is not duplicated inside this revision ZIP to keep the main package compact.

## Current assessment

- Core mathematical result: preserved and sharpened.
- Broad polynomial/access-model novelty: explicitly disclaimed.
- Strongest differentiated result: exact characteristic-two BV complexity under the stated adaptive complete-modal-readout contract.
- Reproducibility: substantially repaired with recovered original evidence plus a fresh P02-targeted run.
- Remaining external-submission work: confirm final public author metadata, obtain one independent specialist proof/priority read, and format for the selected venue.
