# Constrained observation design and joint-versus-sequential safety

**Status: corrected research subdirection within GR.** The v0.3-v0.5 notes are in HISTORY/WORKING_NOTES, preserved byte for byte. They are not three current papers. The common verification scripts and v0.1-v0.5 ledger live once in the parent GR project; BT retains its self-contained versioned verifier package.

The substantive residue is the v0.5 three-chain destructive-interaction and five-state compensating-interaction examples (section Interaction defects): coordinatewise safety need not imply joint safety, and joint safety need not admit a safe first coordinate. Preserve these examples and compare scheduling/selection rules under an explicit permitted observation family and cost model. Much repair/Horn/chain/height-two material now belongs to BT post-audit v2, whose seven-state example strengthens the old eight-state example.

**Excluded:** v0.5 Proposition Connection with classical 2-dimension and its dependent Complexity inheritance corollary. The argument wrongly turns a one-direction comparison condition into an injective order embedding. For a nontrivial chain P=Q, the defined relative observation dimension is zero while classical Boolean embedding dimension is positive. This invalidates that proof of hardness; it does not prove the corrected optimization problem easy or hard.

Current question: which restricted observation families allow efficient safe selection, batch scheduling or certificates beyond classical minimum test-set/hitting-set formulations? GU already owns its exact-dispatch specialization. No new hardness theorem or general solver is claimed.
