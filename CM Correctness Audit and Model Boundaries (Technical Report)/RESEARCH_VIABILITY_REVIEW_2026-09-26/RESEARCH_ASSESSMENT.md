Correctness Audit of Boolean/Modal CM Models

Assessment date: **2026-09-26**. Decision: **KEEP_CORRECTION_AND_TEST_CORPUS**. Suggested review order: **15 of 16**.

**Recommended form:** Canonical correctness/model-boundary technical report.

**External novelty confidence:** Low for bundled theorem novelty; high practical value as a correction and regression resource.

## Decision and contribution

Keep this report. Its strongest purpose is **preventing invalid conclusions from reappearing** across the publication program. That is valuable even if it is not a standalone research paper. A canonical record of corrected claims, exact model contracts, finite counterexamples and reproducible checks can support every other artifact and can be published as a technical report if it is intelligible outside the original conversations.

It should not become a second home for every general theorem subsequently developed in P01, P02 or PC. Nor should standard modal no-cloning or probability-obstruction facts be presented as new discoveries merely because they invalidated a local draft.

## Findings with external antecedents

The distinction between copying a stored coefficient description and cloning an unknown state under an allowed linear operation is fundamental. A software copy operation does not refute a no-cloning theorem. Modal no-cloning and exact-discrimination results already exist in the [Schumacher–Westmoreland](https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2929) and [Diamond–Schumacher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04397) literature.

The support-faithful probability obstruction also has a direct antecedent. In the inspected [“Almost quantum theory”](https://arxiv.org/html/1204.0701) probabilistic-resolution discussion, possible events can be forced to receive zero weight, defeating a strong resolution. The audit’s small forced-zero-event example is a useful regression case, not by itself a new Bell/nonlocality theorem. The distinction between support inclusion, logical contextuality, strong contextuality and probabilistic realization must remain explicit.

These comparisons reinforce the report’s correction role. They do not invalidate the more general chain-ring theorem candidates in P01, whose hypotheses and classification must be checked separately.

## Local division of responsibility

| Audit topic | What remains here | Where substantive generalization belongs |
|---|---|---|
| Inconsistent scalar/multiplication/tensor choices | Model ledger and counterexample | BR/IP/SP/PC as appropriate |
| Finite resource classifications | Original checked instances and provenance | P01 for general Smith results |
| Misleading algorithm or readout claims | Minimal contract-violation examples | P02 for charged-query theorems |
| Compiler/benchmark overclaims | Link to exact dated evidence | CO/SC |
| Failed proof variants | Correction history with scope | Current owner manuscript for corrected theorem |

Counts in old exhaustive runs must retain their exact search universe, state equivalence, basis convention and code revision. A manifest mismatch is not cured by silently changing the manuscript’s count. Some checks were rerun during earlier work and others are inherited; neither category should be relabelled as freshly executed here. The new review contains bounded spot checks and selected direct proofs, not a complete replay of the entire audit archive.

## A useful extension

The strongest additional work would be a **model-contract regression corpus**. Each case would declare scalars, multiplication, tensor product, state normalization, allowed transformations, effect/readout rule and charged resources. A small checker would reproduce the expected counterexample or accepted identity. For example, it should reject using a characteristic-two nilpotent splitter as an invertible Fourier analyzer and distinguish static support from a closed process semantics.

Success would be a portable suite that catches real mistakes in the current manuscript/tool chain and makes their cause understandable. Machine-checked semantics or minimal counterexample certificates could add technical value. A long list of obvious failed analogies without an executable contract would add little. Generic property-based or metamorphic testing is already established methodology, so its use alone is not a novelty claim.

## Publication form and stopping rule

Prepare this as a citable technical report only if it can stand alone with a short account of the models and precise correction tables. Avoid reproducing whole proofs from owner papers. A methods or reproducibility article might become appropriate if the contract-checking artifact is broadly useful, but that is an additional contribution to demonstrate.

No new experimental campaign is needed merely to preserve the present value. Keep the correction ledger authoritative, link it from companion manuscripts, and update it only when a new concrete claim or reproducibility issue arises. This is a necessary support artifact; it does not need to compete with the four strongest research candidates for theorem novelty.

## Evidence and review limits

Current correctness audit including lines 525–649; retained audit packages, model contracts and finite-result manifests.

This is a research triage and selected proof review by one assistant, not an independent expert panel, exhaustive prior-art clearance, acceptance prediction or formal proof certification. Existing agent findings were treated as evidence to check. Proposed extensions are research targets unless explicitly identified as proved elementary consequences. No manuscript is modified by this assessment.

- [Schumacher and Westmoreland — Almost quantum theory](https://arxiv.org/html/1204.0701). Inspected: Relevant full-text sections on states/processes and probabilistic resolutions, including §5.3. Comparison: Mixed subspace states and process semantics already exist; strong probabilistic resolution can fail.

- [Abramsky and Brandenburger — The Sheaf-Theoretic Structure of Non-Locality and Contextuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0264). Inspected: Abstract and primary-record inspection. Comparison: Global-section support hierarchies are established; P01’s candidate contribution is its particular chain-ring classification.
