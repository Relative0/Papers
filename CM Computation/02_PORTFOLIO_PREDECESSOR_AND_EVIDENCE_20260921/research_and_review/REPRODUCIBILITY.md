# Paper B provenance and reproduction

SOURCE_LINEAGE.json identifies the original source and pre-edit hashes. The source was not reconstructed from the supplied PDF. REVISION.diff records only this revision. The original main source, bibliography, PDF and build artifacts are retained in the task baseline and in publication history before updating the authoritative source.

The original check_manuscript.py passes: 50 labels, 18 cited sources. The fresh four-file implementation run in runs/paper_b_current_03 passes116 tests using the source project's interpreter. Runs01/02 retain the missing-dependency and incomplete-copy failures; they are packaging failures, not edited implementation or test failures in the full snapshot. Input/output hashes and full logs are retained.

P14: 15 manifest entries verified, 51,102 raw timing rows parsed, all case ratios in17 comparisons reproduced, and four primary intervals independently recomputed with10000 draws and frozen seed2026091902. The script audit_p14_records.py only reads completed source records. It never generates holdouts or executes timers. Raw records and code retain their original hashes in the supplement. The P14 native environment is Python3.10.11 Windows; the arithmetic audit and current116-test run use separate recorded interpreters. Do not pool their performance or test counts.

The P14 freeze and amendments describe the acquired natural corpus, randomized schedules, endpoint boundaries, local-budget reductions, original analyzer and execution-only indexing change. Correctness occurs outside the timing interval in run_timing.py. Tracemalloc observations are not RSS. The canonical S1/S2 audit is distinct from P14 and has its own raw hashes.

BUILD_MANIFEST.json in05_manuscript records the four-stage TeX/BibTeX build. Table rows derive directly from RECONCILIATION.json. Existing figures and notation are preserved. No confirmatory campaign was run by this publication task.
