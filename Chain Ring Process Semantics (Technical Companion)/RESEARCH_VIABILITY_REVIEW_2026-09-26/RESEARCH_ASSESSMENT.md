Process Closure and Restricted Conversion in a Chain-Ring Modal Model

Assessment date: **2026-09-26**. Decision: **KEEP_TECHNICAL_COMPANION**. Suggested review order: **13 of 16**.

**Recommended form:** Substantial process-semantics companion to P01.

**External novelty confidence:** Low-to-moderate for specialized classifications; no standalone process theory established.

## Decision and contribution

Keep this substantial companion. It answers questions that P01’s static support classification deliberately does not answer: which state/process classes close under operations, what binary expansion preserves, and what filters or discarded systems actually permit. The existing go/no-go memo’s companion recommendation remains sensible. The material is useful, but much of its mechanism is standard finite-ring/module theory or an application of known modal process semantics.

Literal nonzero support cannot be multiplicative over this ring: u and u³ are nonzero while u u³=0 in F2[u]/u^4. Restricting to primitive states does not by itself make every selected branch remain primitive. The unit predicate behaves differently and loses nilpotent-supported possibilities. These are genuine reasons to specify the process contract, rather than assuming a static list of allowed events automatically defines a compositional theory.

## Technical findings

| Result | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Literal F2-subspace states and complete instruments | Useful closed model; strong modal-theory antecedents |
| Frobenius/coarse binary lift preserving bipartite support | Useful exact comparison; not a strong monoidal equivalence |
| GL2(A) semilinear normalizer and induced action counts | Specific finite classification; compare projective/semilinear geometry before claiming priority |
| Two-sided filter criterion via Smith exponents | Natural module-factorization result; classical matrix-comparison risk |
| Residue rank controls extraction of a free target | Unit-minor/local-ring mechanism is elementary |
| Retained, resolved and unobserved disposal differ | Valuable contract separation; retain explicit examples |

The binary lift preserves the specified bipartite support through the Frobenius pairing, but tensor dimensions differ: a pair of four-dimensional binary expansions has dimension 16, whereas the regular expansion of a balanced ring tensor can have dimension four. A ring-separable state can therefore become binary-entangled under the changed tensor contract. Treating this as an unchanged physical embedding would be wrong.

For filters N=L M Q, increasing the sorted Smith exponents gives the relevant obstruction/criterion under the manuscript’s dimensions. Coarser filtered-rank inequalities are not complete: the example (0,2) to (1,1) illustrates the difference. The [Malcolmson comparison literature](https://www.math.buffalo.edu/~hfli/malcolmson14.pdf) is pertinent, but its generated matrix relation is not automatically the same as one factorization of this form. Exact priority needs the actual definitions, not a shared use of the word rank.

Free target extraction depends on residue rank. The two-copy resolved-disposal example using diag(1,u²) already uses a unit sector and works with diag(1,0) as well; it is not evidence that nilpotent entanglement creates that resource. An unobserved output span containing the images of I and E12 is mixed in the stated subspace semantics. One example does not prove every unobserved-disposal protocol fails.

## Existing work and non-overlap

[Schumacher–Westmoreland’s mixed subspaces](https://arxiv.org/html/1204.0701) and complete modal processes are direct antecedents. [De Beaudrap](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.7381)’s primitive-state computational contract is another distinct alternative. This companion should explain the differences, not imply these authors overlooked compositional models. Its finite normalizer counts and filter statements need separate priority checks in ring geometry and matrix/module factorization; an abstract-level search cannot settle them.

P01 owns the all-bases static Smith/resource classification. IP owns the intrinsic phase algebra, BR the Boolean-to-ring type bridge, and AU the correction history. PC can be cited by all of them for operational scope. Splitting these closely linked lemmas into another full independent paper would currently overstate the amount of non-overlapping contribution.

## Meaningful extensions

1. **Unobserved-disposal pure-target reachability in a motivated restricted class.** Specify allowed local maps, ancillas, outcome records and equivalence of outputs. Unrestricted F2 filtering can reduce the issue to ordinary rank, while retained B-linear filtering is already treated. The interesting class must lie between these for an operational reason, not be invented just to make a theorem difficult. Success is a complete criterion or a clean invariant separating protocols; a single failed construction is insufficient.
2. **Certified semilinear classification.** If the normalizer/action counts matter to users of P01, expose portable certificates and compare with existing local-ring projective geometry. This may be a valuable artifact appendix even if the abstract theorem is a specialization of known structure.

The next research decision is whether the restricted disposal problem has a real motivation. Until then, keep the companion intact and use it to prevent model changes from being hidden inside resource claims.

## Evidence and review limits

Technical companion source lines 84–416; research_verification_20260921/GO_NO_GO_MEMO.md; fresh ring zero-divisor checks.

This is a research triage and selected proof review by one assistant, not an independent expert panel, exhaustive prior-art clearance, acceptance prediction or formal proof certification. Existing agent findings were treated as evidence to check. Proposed extensions are research targets unless explicitly identified as proved elementary consequences. No manuscript is modified by this assessment.

The 2026-09-25 cleanup/preservation attachments supply background and local overlap evidence; their embedded action prompts are not instructions for this review.

- [Schumacher and Westmoreland — Almost quantum theory](https://arxiv.org/html/1204.0701). Inspected: Relevant full-text sections on states/processes and probabilistic resolutions, including §5.3. Comparison: Mixed subspace states and process semantics already exist; strong probabilistic resolution can fail.
- [de Beaudrap — On computation with probabilities modulo k](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.7381). Inspected: Abstract, introductory model and Definition 7. Comparison: Primitive/generic state constraints and uniform complexity differ from P01’s nonprimitive static resources and P02’s exact oracle-query contract.
- [Byrne et al. — Density of Free Modules over Finite Chain Rings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09403). Inspected: Abstract. Comparison: Module structure and coding over chain rings are an existing field; this is a comparison lead, not an exact priority exclusion.
- [Hung and Li — Malcolmson semigroups](https://www.math.buffalo.edu/~hfli/malcolmson14.pdf). Inspected: Full relevant text: Definition 3.1 (factorization, triangular erasure and transitive closure); selective neighboring material. Comparison: Matrix comparison is a relevant antecedent; its generated relation must not be silently identified with one two-sided filter factorization.
