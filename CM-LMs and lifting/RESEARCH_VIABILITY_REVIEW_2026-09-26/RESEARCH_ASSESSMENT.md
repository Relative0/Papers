# Research viability assessment — FO

Correspondence and Logical Matrices: A Boolean Operator Calculus

Assessment date: **2026-09-26**. Decision: **KEEP_EXPOSITION_OR_SPECIFICATION**. Suggested review order: **9 of 16**.

**Recommended form:** Coherent CM/LM exposition and typed semantic specification.

**External novelty confidence:** Low for foundational theorem novelty; useful integration remains plausible.

## Decision and contribution

Keep and develop this as an exposition or precise specification, rather than assuming a new foundational mathematical theory. The manuscript’s current positioning is already much better than a broad claim to invent matrix representations of logic. It explicitly credits pointwise truth-vector composition, binary matrix logic, signed input transformations and spectral logical representations. The contribution left is an integrated **formula-valued polarity architecture** with clear typing and commuting semantic operations.

The frame identity M_(X Θ Y)=S_X [Θ] S_Y, with S_X²=I over the Boolean ring, is a compact explanation of how the symbolic and numeric levels relate. Logical pairing becomes an agreement-state calculation. Orthogonal partition selectors preserve Boolean operations because one partition component is active at a valuation. These are useful derivations, but their mechanisms are ordinary Boolean expansion and change of frame. Packaging them into a coherence theorem does not by itself establish a new algebra.

## Claims and boundaries

| Material | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Numeric same-frame operator superposition | Direct antecedent: [Cheng–Zhao–Xu Proposition 3.3](https://skoge.folk.ntnu.no/prost/proceedings/cdc-ecc-2011/data/papers/0224.pdf) |
| Formula-valued polarity lift and coherence of pairing/valuation | Potentially useful integrated presentation; exact priority still open |
| Higher-arity tensors and rectangular flattenings | Standard reindexing with explicit type discipline |
| Rank equals minimum XOR sum of separated conjunctions | Ordinary rank factorization applied to a Boolean-function flattening |
| Sixteen-CM spectral/dynamical atlas | Reference appendix, not another research paper |

The source correctly keeps all-true valuation conditional on compatible reference formulas, rather than assuming arbitrary formulas can simultaneously be true. Its current one-triggered axis-reversal convention is explicit. Historical polarity-mask criticisms must be checked against that revision instead of copied forward as though nothing changed. Rectangular maps also retain all 2^n truth entries: reshaping does not compress an arbitrary function.

Cheng is a particularly close verified antecedent. [Eigenlogic is a neighboring](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/22/2/139) truth-observable construction and should not be described as identical to the F2 eigenanalysis of a raw 2×2 CM. The manuscript itself also cites Bricken’s matrix-logic notes and earlier vector logic. Those inherited references deserve bibliographic checking for any formal publication; their exact public chronology was not independently settled here.

## Existing audits and local ownership

The detailed audit is more useful than its count of passed assertions alone: it identifies type, valuation and convention issues and separates claims. Some historical checker-count statements refer to artifacts that have not all been independently relocated and rerun in this task. The large assertion count is not proof of historical novelty or of every symbolic theorem. The current selected identities were read directly; no new exhaustive FO checker was run.

CO should own compiler implementation and any performance result. GU should own restricted parameter guards. IP adds cyclic convolution, which is a genuinely different multiplication, but not evidence that the Boolean foundation was incomplete. BR specifies scalar enrichment. Keeping those type boundaries in this document can prevent duplication and errors without requiring each boundary to become a standalone paper.

## Useful next forms

1. **An accessible worked exposition.** Choose a reader who already knows truth tables but benefits from typed operator transport. Follow one nontrivial formula through polarity lift, valuation, pairing, block construction and a verified transformation. Success is demonstrably clearer specification or reasoning than the ordinary alternatives; it need not be a new theorem. If the example only rewrites four truth values in heavier notation, shorten the paper into a tutorial/reference note.
2. **A shared verified intermediate representation with CO.** State exact frame, support and output types and check transformations compositionally. This could be a useful tool/specification contribution. It belongs to one coordinated implementation project, not parallel novelty claims for FO and CO.
3. **A comparison atlas.** Give explicit translations to truth vectors, STP-style structure matrices, ANF and logical observables, documenting what is preserved and what changes. Most maps will be elementary; publish for explanatory utility, not as a discovery claim.

The most reasonable next gate is editorial: define the audience, choose the worked use case and write an honest contribution paragraph. A well-attributed technical article is worthwhile if it makes the system usable. Further enumeration of the sixteen binary operators is unlikely to improve research novelty.

## Evidence and review limits

Current LM-centered source, especially lines 314–535, 920–1020 and 1259–1336; detailed CM_LM_Audit_Astra.md; current claims register.

This is a research triage and selected proof review by one assistant, not an independent expert panel, exhaustive prior-art clearance, acceptance prediction or formal proof certification. Existing agent findings were treated as evidence to check. Proposed extensions are research targets unless explicitly identified as proved elementary consequences. No manuscript is modified by this assessment.
