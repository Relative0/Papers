# Gate 4: P02 priority and proof review

Decision: a focused technical note. The qualitative Deutsch obstruction is already identified by James, Ortiz and Sabry (2011), conclusion p.10. Polynomial-method architecture and exact singleton discrimination are established. The specific fully quantified adaptive bounds are proved here, but their priority remains unconfirmed after the bounded primary-source review. No theorem contradiction was found.

## Contribution paragraph fixed before drafting
We give self-contained exact-query proofs for characteristic-two linear modal computation with finite complete recorded instruments. For arbitrary fixed invertible pointwise oracle actions, one query cannot solve Deutsch or Deutsch--Jozsa, and n queries are necessary to recover an n-bit Bernstein--Vazirani secret. Standard XOR queries attain the Deutsch and Bernstein--Vazirani bounds. We make the adaptive branch induction explicit and show why ring-valued kickback does not supply an invertible Fourier analyzer. These statements refine known modal obstructions under explicit access and readout contracts; historical firstness is not claimed.

## Proof audit
Exact discrimination requires a direct sum of label spans. At each adaptive node, recording all branches is injective; induction preserves a nonzero final record for each secret. For Deutsch, perform the sector argument within any nonzero prequery branch; subsequent complete maps cannot resolve the overlap. For DJ, three balanced oracle operators sum to the constant-zero operator. For BV, each branch coefficient has secret degree at most its query count; concatenating finitely many branch coefficient vectors does not increase the number of monomials. A q<n span cannot hold 2^n independent exactly labeled final records. Lower bounds do not require informative G0/G1; matching upper bounds do.

The A-valued phase example uses a balanced tensor over A=F2[u]/u^4. Its regular binary rank is 4+2n, not full rank. The four-cycle oracle is different from standard XOR. UNIQUE-SAT is credited prior art and is a positive control. Simon and description-readout experiments retain finite scope.
