Finite-Jet Rigidity and Ultradifferentiable Realization of Boolean Sign Laws on Orthants and Hyperplane Arrangements

Assessment date: **2026-09-26**. Decision: **CONTINUE_FOCUSED_RESEARCH**. Suggested review order: **3 of 16**.

**Recommended form:** Short analysis article or theorem-driven expository note.

**External novelty confidence:** Moderate: clean synthesis, but close classical mechanisms and open priority.

## Decision and contribution

Continue as a compact analysis project. The strongest feature is the precise bridge from a **nonzero finite jet** to rigidity of chamber signs, and the resulting regularity dichotomy. It is not a new Denjoy–Carleman theorem. The polynomial sign lemma has a very close original argument in the 2014 [Speyer/Wofsey](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/188631/characterizing-orthants-with-polynomials) orthant discussion; [quasianalytic Taylor injectivity](https://arxiv.org/html/2107.01061v2) and nonquasianalytic cutoffs are established analysis. A publishable contribution must therefore lie in the exact finite-jet formulation, arrangement propagation, and a useful unified statement rather than in broad claims about polynomial Boolean representation.

## Proof-level assessment

Near the common corner, write the first nonzero homogeneous Taylor term as P_d. Rescaling into a fixed orthant preserves the imposed weak sign inequality in the limit. Polynomial factor multiplicities then force the chamber sign law to be an affine parity law. This is a short, plausible mechanism. Its strength is that non-affine realizations must have every finite jet zero; its limitation is that a referee may regard the passage from the known polynomial lemma to the leading Taylor term as a modest corollary.

For arrangements, the no-flat-point hypothesis supplies a nonzero leading term at each relevant point. A sufficiently small ball excludes nonincident hyperplanes. Crossing parity is then locally constant along a hyperplane, using generic nearby crossings; connectedness propagates it globally. No contradiction was found in this argument, but this transport deserves a transparent lemma in the final exposition. Zero-set support alone is weaker than a normal-crossing divisor: x y(x²+y²) has the same real hyperplane support but no residual unit at the origin. [Modification-based monomialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09502) literature must be compared under its actual hypotheses.

For the Roumieu convention using k!M_k, the total weight is W_k=k!M_k. This matters when importing the divergence criterion. The squared-cutoff primitive used to construct a positive one-sided selector is appropriate once its support is translated so that its infimum is zero. The counts 2^(m+1) signed parity laws versus 2^r chamber laws only exhibit a strict gap when r>m+1. These details are substantive conditions, not stylistic qualifications.

## Non-overlap and earlier findings

| Claim | Status |
|---|---|
| Polynomial orthant factor-parity obstruction | Close known antecedent; credit explicitly |
| Nonzero finite jet forces parity | Candidate concise contribution/synthesis |
| No-flat-point arrangement propagation and full regularity dichotomy | Best package to compare theorem by theorem |
| C^d version | Already in the current source; not a proposed extension |
| Punctured-domain OR example and failure of literal unit factorization | Useful hypothesis tests, not separate papers |

GU studies which operator regions can be recognized by a restricted guard library. That is distinct from the analytic realizability problem here, even though both use signs. Do not count sign-cell background as two independent discoveries. The older “very high uniqueness” label was a local ownership judgment and is too strong as an external publication verdict. The 12-page historical PDF and current candidate are divergent versions; preserve both, but select and reconcile the actual submission source.

## Extensions worth considering

1. **Quantitative margin versus smoothness.** For a non-affine C^k realization, vanishing of the k-jet and the resulting o(r^k) behavior are already immediate consequences. A genuine extension would fix derivative bounds and an exclusion zone near boundaries, then prove sharp upper/lower bounds on achievable classification margin. Specify the norm and domain before experimenting. Stop if only the qualitative flatness corollary emerges.
2. **Beyond linear arrangements.** Transverse smooth hypersurfaces are locally straightened by standard coordinates, so that case alone is unlikely to justify another paper. Non-normal crossings, global coorientation constraints, or a precise obstruction to gluing local sign realizations offer more substance. First find one example not reducible to the present theorem by a chart change.
3. **Finite certificates of incompatibility.** Inconsistent crossing ratios can certify that any realization must be flat somewhere. The elementary certificate may be a useful explanatory or software artifact, but should not be inflated into a separate theorem program without an algorithmic input model and complexity benefit.

## Practical gate

A narrow article can be worth pursuing even if the proofs are short. The next gate is a careful priority comparison in quasianalytic and arrangement-sign literature, followed by one clean manuscript version. If the whole package is a direct known corollary, publish an attributed analysis note or tutorial rather than force a research-paper claim. There is no need to add quantum or CM application language to justify the mathematics.

## Evidence and review limits

Current source lines 184–340 and 341–514; finite-jet, arrangement, cutoff and counterexample arguments; retained divergent-version evidence.

This is a research triage and selected proof review by one assistant, not an independent expert panel, exhaustive prior-art clearance, acceptance prediction or formal proof certification. Existing agent findings were treated as evidence to check. Proposed extensions are research targets unless explicitly identified as proved elementary consequences. No manuscript is modified by this assessment.

Inspected: Original arguments read; research forum, not a refereed journal. Comparison: Polynomial orthant-sign parity follows from hyperplane factor multiplicities; close antecedent to FJ’s algebraic lemma.
- [Belotto da Silva and Bierstone — Monomialization of a quasianalytic morphism](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09502). Inspected: Abstract and metadata. Comparison: Modification-based monomialization is not literal unit factorization in the original coordinates; theorem-level comparison remains open.
